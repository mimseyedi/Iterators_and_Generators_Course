def spy(iterable, n=1):
    """Return a 2-tuple with a list containing the first *n* elements of
    *iterable*, and an iterator with the same items as *iterable*.
    This allows you to "look ahead" at the items in the iterable without
    advancing it.

    There is one item in the list by default:

        >>> iterable = 'abcdefg'
        >>> head, iterable = spy(iterable)
        >>> head
        ['a']
        >>> list(iterable)
        ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']

    You may use unpacking to retrieve items instead of lists:

        >>> (head,), iterable = spy('abcdefg')
        >>> head
        'a'
        >>> (first, second), iterable = spy('abcdefg', 2)
        >>> first
        'a'
        >>> second
        'b'

    The number of items requested can be larger than the number of items in
    the iterable:

        >>> iterable = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> head, iterable = spy(iterable, 10)
        >>> head
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> list(iterable)
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
